# Terms of use

Last updated: April 23, 2019

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the JustSmartContracts.dev website (the "Service") operated by its authors ("us", "we", or "our"). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

## General information

The website is still in its beta version. The Service is provided “as is” without any representations or warranties, express or implied. We are not responsible for any loss: Ethereum, JustSmartContracts.dev, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have thoroughly tested, there is always the possibility something unexpected happens that causes your funds to be lost. Always double check transaction parameters and contract address.

## Links To Other Web Sites

Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by JustSmartContracts.dev. JustSmartContracts.dev has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that JustSmartContracts.dev shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services. We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.

## Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
