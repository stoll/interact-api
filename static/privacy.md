# Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 08, 2019

## General

Welcome to Interact, a free, open-source, client-side tool for interacting with Ethereum blockchain. We do not collect, hold or store keys, account information or passwords. We do not collect personal data passively, do not monetize collection of data, and do not use your data for marketing or advertising.

## Blockchain

However, due to the natural transparency of Ethereum blockchain, transactions that users send via Interact may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address, the public address of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Information stored on a blockchain may be public, immutable, and difficult or even impossible to remove or delete. Transactions and addresses may reveal information about the userâ€™s identity and information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. Users are encouraged to review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain works.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Please make sure you stay updated on this page, and comply with any regulations, when you use this repository (and any related).
